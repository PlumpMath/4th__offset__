### web-app-server


this the initial server for serving the web-app. later optimisations would be added and config would change, for now it's pretty simple.


For now this server contains the Primus websocket endpoint, but later that will be separated to a different endpoint with CORS configured.



For development I recommend:

`nodemon -x iced server_000_.iced`
